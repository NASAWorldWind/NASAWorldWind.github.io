 * 
 * <p>Description: Themeable, WAI-ARIA-compliant toolbar component.
 * 
 * <p>The JET Toolbar component can contain [JET Buttons]{@link oj.ojButton}, [JET Buttonsets]{@link oj.ojButtonset}, and non-focusable content 
 * such as separator icons.  Toolbar provides WAI-ARIA-compliant focus management.
 * 
 * <p>A toolbar that contains radios should contain all radios in the radio group.

 * 
 * <p>Any buttonsets placed in the toolbar should have <code class="prettyprint">focusManagement</code> set to <code class="prettyprint">"none"</code>, 
 * so as not to compete with the toolbar's focus management.  
 * 
 * <p>The application should not do anything to interfere with the Toolbar's focus management, such as setting the <code class="prettyprint">tabindex</code> 
 * of the buttons.  Also, enabled buttons should remain user-visible, without which arrow-key navigation to the button would cause the focus to 
 * seemingly disappear.

 * </h3>
 * 
 * <p>JET Toolbar takes care of focus management, as noted above.  
 * 
 * <p>As shown in the online demos, the application is responsible for applying <code class="prettyprint">aria-label</code> and/or 
 * <code class="prettyprint">aria-controls</code> attributes to the toolbar element, if applicable per the instructions that follow:
 * 
 * <p>If this toolbar is (or might be) placed in context with other toolbars, then the application should apply an 
 * <code class="prettyprint">aria-label</code> to the toolbar element to distinguish it, e.g. an "Edit" toolbar.  The 
 * <code class="prettyprint">aria-label</code> is optional when there is only one toolbar.
 * 
 * <p>If the toolbar is controlling something else on the page, e.g. bold / italic / underline buttons controlling a rich 
 * text editor, then the application should apply an <code class="prettyprint">aria-controls</code> attribute to the toolbar element, 
 * e.g. <code class="prettyprint">aria-controls="myTextEditor"</code>.
 * 
 * <p>Disabled content: JET supports an accessible luminosity contrast ratio, 
 * as specified in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-contrast">WCAG 2.0 - Section 1.4.3 "Contrast"</a>, 
 * in the themes that are accessible.  (See the "Theming" chapter of the JET Developer Guide for more information on which 
 * themes are accessible.)  Note that Section 1.4.3 says that text or images of text that are part of an inactive user 
 * interface component have no contrast requirement.  Because disabled content may not meet the minimum contrast ratio 
 * required of enabled content, it cannot be used to convey meaningful information.<p>

 *   Reading direction
 *   <a class="bookmarkable-link" title="Bookmarkable Link" href="#rtl-section"></a>
 * </h3>
 * 
 * <p>The only supported way to set the reading direction (LTR or RTL) is to set the <code class="prettyprint">"dir"</code> attribute on the 
 * <code class="prettyprint">&lt;html></code> element of the page.  As with any JET component, in the unusual case that the reading direction
 * is changed post-create, the toolbar must be <code class="prettyprint">refresh()</code>ed, or the page must be reloaded.

 * 
 * <p>The <code class="prettyprint">:oj-toolbar</code> pseudo-selector can be used in jQuery expressions to select JET Toolbars.  For example:
 * 
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * <code>$( ":oj-toolbar" ) // selects all JET Toolbars on the page
 * $myEventTarget.closest( ":oj-toolbar" ) // selects the closest ancestor that is a JET Toolbar

 *   Declarative Binding
 *   <a class="bookmarkable-link" title="Bookmarkable Link" href="#binding-section"></a>
 * </h3>
 * 
 * <p>For components like Toolbar and Menu that contain a number of like items, applications may wish to use a <code class="prettyprint">foreach</code> Knockout binding 
 * to stamp out the contents.  This binding cannot live on the same node as the JET <code class="prettyprint">ojComponent</code> binding, and must instead live on a nested 
 * virtual element as follows:
 * 
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * <code>&lt;div id="myToolbar"
 *      data-bind="ojComponent: {component: 'ojToolbar'}">
 *     &lt;!-- ko foreach: myButtons -->
 *         &lt;button data-bind="attr: {id: id}, 
 *                            ojComponent: { component: 'ojButton', label: label }">

 * 
 * <ol>
 *   <li>All JQUI and JET components inherit <code class="prettyprint">disable()</code> and <code class="prettyprint">enable()</code> methods from the base class.  This API 
 *       duplicates the functionality of the <code class="prettyprint">disabled</code> option.  In JET, to keep the API as lean as possible, we 
 *       have chosen not to document these methods outside of this section.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>Also, event names for all JET components are prefixed with "oj", instead of component-specific prefixes like "toolbar" or "menu".  
 * E.g. if JQUI had a toolbar component, and if it followed the usual pattern, then it would have a <code class="prettyprint">toolbarcreate</code> 
 * event, while JET's is called <code class="prettyprint">ojcreate</code>, as shown in the doc for that event.
 * Reason:  This makes the API more powerful.  It allows apps to listen to "foo" events from <em>all</em> JET components via:
 * 
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * <code>$( ".selector" ).on( "ojfoo", myFunc);
 * </code></pre>
 * 
 * or to "foo" events only from JET Toolbars (the JQUI functionality) via:
 * 
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * <code>$( ".selector" ).on( "ojfoo", ":oj-toolbar", myFunc);
 * </code></pre>

    // 
    // $button contains 0 or more buttons to map.  Must be enabled since disabled buttons aren't tabbable.
    // Returns the mapped JQ object (which the caller will make the tabstop).
    // 
    // We know that this.$enabledButtons contains all buttons in $button, and all of their potentially checked radio-groupmates, since:
    // - The above "enabled" requirement guarantees that $button's contents are all in $enabledButtons.
    // - The prohibition against radio groupmates that are not in the toolbar, and the prohibition against checked disabled groupmates 
    //   of enabled radios, guarantee that if $button is a radio, then all of its potentially checked groupmates are enabled and thus in 
    //   $enabledButtons.
    // 
    // Firefox browser issue:   (TODO: should we doc this?  File FF and/or JET bug?)
    // 
    // When this method maps an unchecked radio to its checked groupmate, the caller ensures that the former still has focus, but the latter
    // is the tabstop for when the user tabs out and back in.  When tabbing / Shift-Tabbing from the unchecked radio in the direction of the 
    // checked one, Chrome and IE9 are smart enough to tab out of the radio group to the adjacent tabstop as desired.  But in FF, focus goes to 
    // the checked one, which is not what we want.
    // 
    // Reason: Chrome and IE9 are smart enough never to tab within a radio group.  If focus is in the radio group, Tab and Shift-Tab exit the radio group.
    // But in FF, [a radio is reachable via Tab/Shift-Tab from within the group] if [it's enabled, tabindex != -1, and either checked or has no 
    // checked groupmates], i.e. [it would be reachable via Tab/Shift-Tab from outside the group if all its groupmates happened to be untabbable 
    // (e.g. disabled)].  In other words, FF is the only one that fails to distinguish between radios that could be valid tabstops from outside, and
    // those that should be valid tabstops from inside.  
    // 
    // This impl improves on the native behavior.  In FF, in an unchecked radio group, every single radio is a tabstop.  Our use of tabindex=-1 
    // guarantees that we never tab within the group in that case.  It's only a checked groupmate that can be tabbed to from within. (So at 
    // most one unwanted tabstop.)
    // 
    // After much time and effort, the latter issue seems to be infeasible to fix in any robust, non-brittle way.  E.g.:
    // - Clearing all tabstops and restoring on tab-out of toolbar:  FF provides no reliable way to find out whether a blur is exiting the entire 
    //   toolbar.  The obvious setTimeout workaround needed to be unacceptably long (e.g. 250ms) and even then was unreliable.  If we ever fail 
    //   to restore the tabstop, the toolbar becomes untabbable and inaccessible.
    // - Every other approach had similar robustness issues.
