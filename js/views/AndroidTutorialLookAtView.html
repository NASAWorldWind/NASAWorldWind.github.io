    <h1>Look At View Tutorial</h1>
    <img src="images/look-at-view.png" class="screenshot"/>

    <p>
        Demonstrates how to use LookAt to view a position. This example also shows how to compute great circle distance
        and
        azimuth between two positions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This example simulates a view from an aircraft above Santa Monica, CA looking at the LAX airport.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <h3>CameraViewFragment.java</h3>
    <p>
        The LookAtViewFragment class extends the BasicGlobeFragment and overrides the createWorldWindow method.
        Here we position the Navigator's camera at an aircraft's location and point the camera at a nearby airport.
