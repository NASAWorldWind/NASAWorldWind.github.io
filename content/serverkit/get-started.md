        ### To Build

        WWSK uses [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for a build system. To build WWSK and its dependencies, run maven
        from the root of the WWSK repository:

        $ mvn clean install

        ---

        ### To Run

        Depending on your personal preference, there are several ways to run WWSK.

        1. Deploy a standalone WWSK distribution
        2. Deploy a WAR file
        3. Run in NetBeans
        4. Run in Jetty from Maven
        5. Deploy a binary distribution

        Detailed instructions for each of these options are available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindServerKit/blob/develop/README.md">GitHub</a>.
