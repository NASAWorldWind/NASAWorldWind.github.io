## Get Started

---

### Build

WWSK uses [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) for a build system. To build WWSK and its dependencies, run maven
from the root of the WWSK repository:

    $ mvn clean install

---

### Run

Depending on your personal preference, there are several ways to run WWSK.

1. Deploy a standalone WWSK distribution
2. Deploy a WAR file
3. Run in NetBeans
4. Run in Jetty from Maven
5. Deploy a binary distribution

Detailed instructions for each of these options are available on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindServerKit/blob/develop/README.md">GitHub</a>.
