### WMS Layers
World Wind is a free, open source API for a virtual globe. World Wind allows developers to quickly and easily create interactive visualizations of 3D globe, map and geographical information. Organizations across the world use World Wind to monitor weather patterns, visualize cities and terrain, track the movement of planes, vehicles and ships, analyze geospatial data, and educate people about the Earth.

World Wind's source code, official releases, engineering roadmap, issue tracking and more are hosted by GitHub and managed by the NASA World Wind development team.
