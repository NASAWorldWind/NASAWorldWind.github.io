## Development Environment Setup

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) is the IDE used by the WorldWind development team. It includes all the tools you need to build apps for Android. If you haven't done so already, download and install Android Studio.

### Installation Notes
When you perform the installation you can choose the *Standard Setup*, which will download the required Android SDK components.
### Prerequisites
Android Studio requires a compatible [Java SE Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) be installed on your computer. The installation instructions may prompt you to download and install an appropriate JDK (JDK 8 is recommended).
### Learning more about the Android Platform
- Familiarize yourself with the [Android Developer's Site](http://developer.android.com/).
- Read "[Introduction to Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/index.html)" and "[Application Fundamentals](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html)" in the [Android Developer's Guide](http://developer.android.com/guide/).
