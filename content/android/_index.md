### Overview

WorldWind Android is a 3D virtual globe API for Android. You can use it to provide a geographic context, complete with terrain, for visualizing geographic or geo-located information.

WorldWind Android provides high-resolution terrain and imagery, retrieved from remote servers automatically as needed. You can also provide your own terrain and imagery. WorldWind Android additionally provides a rich collection of shapes that you can use to represent information on the globe or in space.

The WorldWind Android client is compatible to [API level](https://source.android.com/source/build-numbers) 19 (KitKat 4.4) and up. It displays the globe via the [GLSurfaceView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/opengl/GLSurfaceView.html). Read more about how to integrate WorldWind into your app in the [Get Started](/android/get-started/) section. See how to implement basic functionality in the [Tutorials](/android/tutorials/) and dive into more topics in the [Developer Guide](/android/developer-guide/).
