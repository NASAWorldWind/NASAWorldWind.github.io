## Deployment

Deploying Web World Wind is easy. In fact, unless you want to run it from your own server there is no deployment required. You simply include a script tag linking to it:

```html
<script src="http://worldwindserver.net/webworldwind/worldwindlib.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

To deploy Web World Wind on your own server, copy the library worldwindlib.js and the images directory from the Web World Wind release and place them on your web server. The images directory must be a sibling of the library, i.e., exist in the same directory. These files are included in the release zip file.

### Running Locally

If you do not already have a web server, you can use Pythonâ€˜s built in HTTP server.

With Python installed on your computer, change directory to the top-level Web World Wind directory and run the Python HTTP server:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Or if using Python 3:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then browse to

```
http://localhost:8000/examples/BasicExample.html
```

and you should see that Web World Wind example in your web browser.
